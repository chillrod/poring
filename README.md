## Why

This project serve as a part of study of CLI environments. And node environment in general.

But... I made it to help me and my work colleagues with locale translation of our services.

So, this project main idea is to help people... So we accept help as well.

LibreTranslate itself is open source, so...
Poring accept's contribution and free usage of this written code.
